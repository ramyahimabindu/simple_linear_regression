# simple_linear_regression
This repository contains two datasets, both based on simple linear regression. 
I have written both in ipynb format. 

#libraries used

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib

#visualization

Since this is just a two variable problem, I have used scatter plot to demonstrate linear regression and the predictions. To predict the actual values and predicted values of test set and training set, scatter plot with a regressor line is the best option. 

#usage

The salary_ipynb deals with predicting salary hike for a candidate. To predict the salary, just input the X factor- number of years of experience and the regressor will predict the salary. You can input the numbers at 
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

The delivery_time.ipynb also follows the exact smae approach. To predict the delivery time, you need to input the sorting numbers.
